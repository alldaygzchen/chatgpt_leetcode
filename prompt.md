Common Data Structure/Algorithm Hints

Problem Type	Likely Data Structure/Algorithm
Find something in a sorted array	Binary Search
Find the shortest path in a graph	BFS, Dijkstra, A* Algorithm
Group or count frequencies	Hashmap/Dictionary
Find connected components	Union-Find, DFS/BFS
Parentheses or nested structures	Stack
Largest/smallest in a stream	Heap/Priority Queue
Subarray with specific properties	Sliding Window, Prefix Sum
String pattern matching	Hashmap, KMP, Rabin-Karp
Generate permutations/combinations	Backtracking
Partitioning or breaking a problem	Dynamic Programming (DP)
Scheduling tasks	Greedy, Priority Queue
Repeated calculations with overlapping subproblems	Memoization/DP


would you add more problem type and solutions which are effective for leetcodein the table
```

```
please give leetcode problem example(just the title) for each problem type according to its Likely Data Structure/Algorithm. It would be better if each problem type contain 5 examples relative and effective for preparing my interview> Give me using the first table which i give you,many thanks
```

```
please review heap and explain what, when, why should we use it and give me tips for remembering it
```
